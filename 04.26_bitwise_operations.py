# Besides the normal numeric operations like addition subtraction and so on, Python supports most of the numeric expressions available in the C language. This includes operators taht treat integers as strings of binary bits, and can come in handy if your Python code must deal with things like network packets, serial ports, or packed binary data produced by a C program.
