# Name four of Python's core data types:
# Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, suples, files, and sets


# Why are they called core?
# Because everything else is built off of them. You can divide them further.
# Becasue the yare part of the Python language itself and are always avaialbe. 

#3 What does "immutable" mean, and which three of Python's core types are considered immutable?

# Immutable means that once you've initialized the object, you can't change it. You can re-assign it, but you can't change it.
# Three core types that are considered immutable are strings, numbers and tuples.
# An immutable object is an object that cannot be changed after it is created. Numebrs, strings, and tuples in Python fall into this category.

#4 What does "sequence' mean" and which three types fall into that category?
# Sequence means that the objects are stored next to each other in memory. 

# A 'sequence' is a positinoally ordered collection of objects. Strings, lists, and tuples are all sequences in Python. They share common sequence operations, such as indexing, concatenatino, and slicing, but also have type-specific method calls. A related term, 'iterable' means either a physical sequence, or a virtual one that produces its items on request.

#5 What does mapping mean, and which core type is a mapping?
# Mapping is poiting from one thing to another
# Or possibly iterating through a list and doing the same thing to each item in the list?
# The term "mapping" deotes an object that maps keys to associated valuess. 

# What is polymorphism and why should you care?
# Its the ability to call the same method on two different objects and have them both respond. Its the idea that we care about what an object does and not what it is.
# Polymorphism means that the maning of an operation (lake a +) depends on the object being operated on. The idea is not constraining code to specific types makes that code aytomatically applicable to many types.
